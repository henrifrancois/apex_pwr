# Apex Power Ranking

The Apex Power Ranking (APR) is a tool to gauge a player's skill level and an attempt to make a tool capable of classifying players as professionals or not. The APR incorporates a player's competitive history, ranked history, competition experience and overall playtime to produce a score that can correlate with skill level. The project is always open to contributors, in the form of code, documentation or raising issues and providing suggestions.
